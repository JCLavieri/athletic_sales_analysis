# Athletic Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is an analytical deep dive into athletic wear sales in the United States over a two-year period. We aim to uncover key insights into sales trends across various cities and evaluate the performance of different retailers, with a special focus on women's athletic footwear.

## Objectives
- Analyze which cities in the U.S. have the highest sales of athletic wear over two years.
- Identify retailers with the highest total sales for athletic wear.
- Examine sales data for women's athletic footwear to identify top-selling retailers.
- Determine peak sales periods for women's athletic footwear, both daily and weekly.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes the following datasets:
- `athletic_sales_2020.csv`: Athletic wear sales data for the year 2020.
- `athletic_sales_2021.csv`: Athletic wear sales data for the year 2021.

## Methodology
- Data combination and cleaning, ensuring uniformity in column names and data types.
- Usage of `groupby` and `pivot_table` functions for data aggregation.
- Conversion of `invoice_date` to datetime format for time series analysis.
- Application of resampling methods for identifying peak sales times.
